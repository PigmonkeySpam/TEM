# Improvements for GUI stuff
**Get the program more usable by an end user.**
- So more general methods for creating a button that already has a box, label and has the label text wrapped and stuff:
 - New button - bosh you have a useable button
- `checkArg()` all the things
- test box with multiple labels
- 
- Refactor to be more like other APIs where it return an `API` object that can access everything else
- Create a readme
- progress bars
- toggle buttons
- Big Font support could be cool
